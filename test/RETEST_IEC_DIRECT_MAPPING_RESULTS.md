# IEC DIRECT MAPPING - RETEST RESULTS

**Test Date**: 2025-11-10 11:24 AM  
**Test ID**: 7808020703087  
**Backend Status**: ✅ **WORKING PERFECTLY**  
**Frontend Status**: ⚠️ **PARTIAL DISPLAY ISSUE**

---

## 🎯 TEST OBJECTIVE

Verify that the simplified IEC direct mapping is working correctly:
- IEC `ward_id` → `ward_code` in our system
- IEC `vd_number` → `voting_district_code` in our system

### Form Display Status

| Field | Value in State | Displayed in Form | Status |
|-------|----------------|-------------------|--------|
| Province | `GP` | ✅ "Gauteng" | **WORKING** |
| Region (District) | `JHB` | ✅ "City of Johannesburg" | **WORKING** |
| Sub-Region (Municipality) | `JHB` | ❌ "Select a sub-region..." | **NOT DISPLAYED** |
| Ward | `79800135` | ❌ Disabled | **BLOCKED** |

### MUI Warnings

```
MUI: You have provided an out-of-range value `79800135` for the select component.
MUI: You have provided an out-of-range value `32871326` for the select component.
```

These warnings indicate that the values `79800135` and `32871326` are not in the dropdown options list.

## 🔍 ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS

### Issue 1: Sub-Region (Municipality) Not Displaying
- **State**: `municipal_code: "JHB"` is set correctly
- **Problem**: The GeographicSelector component is not displaying it
- **Impact**: Blocks Ward and Voting District from being enabled

### Issue 2: Ward Value Not in Dropdown
- **State**: `ward_code: "79800135"` is set correctly
- **Problem**: The ward dropdown doesn't have an option with value `"79800135"`
- **Reason**: The wards table likely uses different ward codes (e.g., "JHB135" instead of "79800135")

### Issue 3: Voting District Value Not in Dropdown
- **State**: `voting_district_code: "32871326"` is set correctly
- **Problem**: The voting district dropdown doesn't have an option with value `"32871326"`
- **Reason**: The voting_districts table likely doesn't have records with these IEC codes

## 📊 SUMMARY

| Component | Status | Details |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| **Backend API** | ✅ **COMPLETE** | Direct mapping working perfectly |
| **IEC ward_id → ward_code** | ✅ **COMPLETE** | Returns "79800135" |
| **IEC vd_number → voting_district_code** | ✅ **COMPLETE** | Returns "32871326" |
| **Frontend State** | ✅ **COMPLETE** | All values set correctly |
| **Frontend Display** | ❌ **ISSUE** | Values not in dropdown options |

---

## 🎯 CONCLUSION

**Backend Implementation**: ✅ **100% COMPLETE AND WORKING**

The simplified direct mapping is working perfectly:
- IEC `ward_id` (79800135) is being used directly as `ward_code`
- IEC `vd_number` (32871326) is being used directly as `voting_district_code`

**Frontend Issue**: ⚠️ **DATABASE MISMATCH**

The problem is that our `wards` and `voting_districts` tables don't have records with these IEC codes:
- Our wards table likely has `ward_code: "JHB135"` instead of `"79800135"`
- Our voting_districts table likely doesn't have `voting_district_code: "32871326"`

**Next Steps**:
1. Either update our database to use IEC codes
2. Or create a mapping layer between IEC codes and our internal codes
3. Or make the dropdowns accept and display the IEC codes even if not in the database
