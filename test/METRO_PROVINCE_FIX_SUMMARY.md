# Metro Province Resolution Fix - Summary

## 🐛 Problem Identified

### Issue Description
Members from metro sub-regions like "ETH - Central", "JHB - A", "CPT - Zone 1" were not getting their **province** inserted into the database during ingestion.

### Affected Municipalities
- **53 metro sub-regions** across 8 metropolitan municipalities:
  - **ETH** (eThekwini): ETH001-ETH010 (10 sub-regions) - KwaZulu-Natal
  - **JHB** (Johannesburg): JHB001-JHB007 (7 sub-regions) - Gauteng
  - **CPT** (Cape Town): CPT001-CPT010 (10 sub-regions) - Western Cape
  - **EKU** (Ekurhuleni): EKU001-EKU005 (5 sub-regions) - Gauteng
  - **TSH** (Tshwane): TSH001-TSH006 (6 sub-regions) - Gauteng
  - **MAN** (Mangaung): MAN001-MAN004 (4 sub-regions) - Free State
  - **BUF** (Buffalo City): BUF001-BUF004 (4 sub-regions) - Eastern Cape
  - **NMA** (Nelson Mandela Bay): NMA001-NMA007 (7 sub-regions) - Eastern Cape

### Root Cause
1. Metro sub-regions have **NO `district_code`** (it's NULL in the database)
2. The ingestion script's `resolve_geographic_hierarchy()` function tried to resolve province through:
   ```
   ward → municipality → district → province
   ```
3. Since `district_code` was NULL, the province lookup failed
4. The code at line 423 tried to query `municipalities.province_code` which **doesn't exist** in the schema
5. The exception was silently caught, resulting in NULL province values

## ✅ Solution Implemented

### Changes Made to `flexible_membership_ingestionV2.py`

#### 1. Added Municipality-to-Province Mapping (Lines 382-410)
Created a new pre-loaded mapping that handles both regular municipalities and metro sub-regions:

```python
# Load municipality -> province mapping (for metros and sub-regions)
self.cursor.execute("""
    SELECT 
        m.municipality_code,
        COALESCE(d.province_code, parent_d.province_code) as province_code,
        COALESCE(p.province_name, parent_p.province_name) as province_name
    FROM municipalities m
    LEFT JOIN districts d ON m.district_code = d.district_code
    LEFT JOIN provinces p ON d.province_code = p.province_code
    LEFT JOIN municipalities parent_m ON m.parent_municipality_id = parent_m.municipality_id
    LEFT JOIN districts parent_d ON parent_m.district_code = parent_d.district_code
    LEFT JOIN provinces parent_p ON parent_d.province_code = parent_p.province_code
    WHERE COALESCE(d.province_code, parent_d.province_code) IS NOT NULL
""")
```

**How it works:**
- For regular municipalities: Gets province from their district
- For metro sub-regions: Gets province from parent metro's district using `parent_municipality_id`
- Uses `COALESCE` to try direct district first, then parent's district

#### 2. Updated `resolve_geographic_hierarchy()` Function (Lines 448-452)
Added fallback to use the new mapping:

```python
# Try to get province from municipality_to_province mapping (for metros and sub-regions)
if not result['province_code'] and muni_code in self.municipality_to_province:
    prov_code, prov_name = self.municipality_to_province[muni_code]
    result['province_code'] = prov_code
    result['province_name'] = prov_name
```

#### 3. Initialized New Dictionary (Line 52)
```python
self.municipality_to_province = {}  # municipality_code -> (province_code, province_name) - for metros
```

## 🧪 Testing Results

### Test Script: `test/test_metro_province_fix.py`

**Results:**
```
✅ All 10 test metro sub-regions resolved correctly:
   ✓ ETH001: KZN - KwaZulu-Natal
   ✓ ETH002: KZN - KwaZulu-Natal
   ✓ JHB001: GP - Gauteng
   ✓ JHB002: GP - Gauteng
   ✓ CPT001: WC - Western Cape
   ✓ EKU001: GP - Gauteng
   ✓ TSH001: GP - Gauteng
   ✓ MAN001: FS - Free State
   ✓ BUF001: EC - Eastern Cape
   ✓ NMA001: EC - Eastern Cape

✅ Total municipalities with province mapping: 266
✅ Metro sub-regions with province mapping: 53
✅ Ward-based geographic resolution: WORKING

## 📊 Database Structure Understanding

### Municipalities Table
```
municipality_id (PK)
municipality_code
municipality_name
district_code (FK) → districts.district_code
parent_municipality_id (FK) → municipalities.municipality_id
```

**Note:** NO `province_code` column in municipalities table!

### Geographic Hierarchy

**Regular Municipalities:**
```
Municipality → District → Province
```

**Metro Sub-Regions:**
```
Metro Sub-Region → Parent Metro → District → Province
```

**Example:**
```
ETH001 (ETH - Central)
  ↓ parent_municipality_id = 441
ETH (Ethekwini Metropolitan Municipality)
  ↓ district_code = 'ETH'
District 'ETH' (eThekwini)
  ↓ province_code = 'KZN'
Province 'KZN' (KwaZulu-Natal)
```

## 🎯 Impact

### Before Fix
- **53 metro sub-regions** had NULL province values
- Members from Gauteng, KwaZulu-Natal, Western Cape, Eastern Cape, and Free State metros were missing province data
- Geographic analysis and reporting was incomplete

### After Fix
- **All 266 municipalities** now have province mappings
- **100% coverage** for metro sub-regions
- Province data correctly inserted during ingestion
- Geographic hierarchy resolution working for all municipalities

## 📝 Files Modified

1. **`flexible_membership_ingestionV2.py`**
   - Added `municipality_to_province` mapping
   - Updated `load_geographic_hierarchy()` method
   - Updated `resolve_geographic_hierarchy()` method

---

## 🔍 Verification Steps

To verify the fix is working:

1. **Run the test script:**
   ```bash
   python test/test_metro_province_fix.py
   ```

2. **Check existing data:**
   ```sql
   SELECT 
       municipality_code,
       municipality_name,
       province_code,
       province_name,
       COUNT(*) as member_count
   FROM members_consolidated
   WHERE municipality_code LIKE 'ETH%' 
      OR municipality_code LIKE 'JHB%'
      OR municipality_code LIKE 'CPT%'
   GROUP BY municipality_code, municipality_name, province_code, province_name
   ORDER BY municipality_code;
   ```

3. **Re-ingest test file:**
   ```bash
   python -c "from flexible_membership_ingestionV2 import FlexibleMembershipIngestion; \
   ingestion = FlexibleMembershipIngestion('uploads', {...}); \
   ingestion.process_single_file('uploads/test_file.xlsx')"
   ```

## ✅ Status

**FIXED** ✓

All metro sub-regions now correctly resolve their province during ingestion.
