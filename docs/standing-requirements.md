# Standing Requirements

## 1. Introduction
This document outlines the standing requirements for wards/branches and municipalities in the membership system. These requirements ensure that organizational units maintain adequate membership levels and representation.

## 2. Ward/Branch Standing Requirements

### 2.1 Good Standing Criteria
For a ward/branch to be considered in **good standing**, it must meet the following criteria:

- **Minimum Membership**: The ward/branch must have **200 or more active members**.

## 3. Municipality Representation Requirements

### 3.1 Representation Criteria
For a municipality to be considered adequately represented, it must meet the following criteria:

- **Minimum Ward Representation**: At least **65% of the wards** within the municipality must be in **good standing** (have 200+ members).

This representation percentage is calculated as: (Number of wards with 200+ members / Total number of wards in the municipality) × 100%.
