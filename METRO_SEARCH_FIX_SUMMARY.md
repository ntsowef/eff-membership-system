# Metro Member Search Fix - Executive Summary

## 🎯 Issues Fixed

### Issue #1: Province-Level Member Search
**Problem**: When filtering members by province, metro sub-region members were excluded from results.

**Example**: Searching for members in Gauteng (GP) returned only 27,486 members instead of 100,765.

**Impact**: 73,279 members (72.7% of Gauteng) were invisible in province searches.

### Issue #2: Membership Directory Search
**Problem**: The membership directory search returned no results for members in metro sub-regions.

**Impact**: Members from major cities (Johannesburg, Tshwane, Cape Town, eThekwini, etc.) were not searchable.

## ✅ Solution Applied

Fixed the `vw_member_details` database view to properly handle metropolitan municipality hierarchies by using `COALESCE` to resolve province and district codes through parent municipalities when direct codes are NULL.

### Technical Change
```sql
-- Before (BROKEN)
LEFT JOIN districts d ON mu.district_code = d.district_code

-- After (FIXED)
LEFT JOIN municipalities pm ON mu.parent_municipality_id = pm.municipality_id
LEFT JOIN districts d ON mu.district_code = d.district_code
LEFT JOIN districts pd ON pm.district_code = pd.district_code
...
COALESCE(mu.district_code, pm.district_code) as district_code
COALESCE(d.province_code, pd.province_code) as province_code
```
